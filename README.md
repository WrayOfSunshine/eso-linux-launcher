# eso-linux-launcher
Launcher for Elder Scrolls Online on Linux with a addon updater and a TTC price table updater.

Starts ESO through steam and closes the ESO launcher once ESO starts (this is reported to improve performance), keeps addons updated with https://www.esoui.com, keeps TTC price table up to date https://us.tamrieltradecentre.com/

By default this is setup to work with the native steam launcher version of ESO (not the run-Steam-itself-under-Proton version), check ell.sh for the comments up top if you want to use it without steam.

---

### Usage

Make ell.sh executable `chmod u+x ell.sh`

Run ell.sh `./ell.sh`

You can use the `The Elder Scrolls Online.desktop` file, edit it with a text editor, change `Exec=/home/kevin/Documents/eso-linux-launcher/ell.sh` to where you have `ell.sh` and put `The Elder Scrolls Online.desktop` on your desktop, you can then double click it to launch ell.sh.

---

### Addons

The script will only check for addon updates if you haven't checked in the past 4 hours - to reduce load on the esoui servers.

#### Updating / adding Addons:

If you want it to update your addons, put the links to the addons in addons.txt,
one per line. For example:

`https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1536-ActionDurationReminder.html`  
`https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info57-HarvestMap.html`


Then run `ESO_ADDONS_PATH=/PATH/TO/ESO/AddOns UPDATE_ADDONS=1 ell.sh` changing `/PATH/TO/ESO/Addons`, for example `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/306130/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/My Documents/Elder Scrolls Online/live/AddOns`


#### Deleting Addons:

If you want to delete an addon, put the word `del` with a space in front of the line in addons.txt ; example:

`del https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1536-ActionDurationReminder.html ActionDurationReminder 3.3.6c ActionDurationReminder`

#### Force updating Addons:

If you want to delete or add new addons and don't want to wait 4 hours, you can make the script check the addons.txt file again:

`FORCE_UPDATE=1 ./addons.sh ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/306130/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/"My Documents/Elder Scrolls Online"/live/AddOns`

---

### TTC

The script will only update the TTC price table if you haven't updated it in 12 hours or more - to prevent downloading too often.

If you want it to keep the TTC price table up to date run ell.sh like so:

`ESO_ADDONS_PATH=/PATH/TO/ESO/AddOns UPDATE_TTC=1 ell.sh`

You can upate addons and TTC also:

`ESO_ADDONS_PATH=/PATH/TO/ESO/AddOns UPDATE_TTC=1 UPDATE_ADDONS=1 ell.sh`
